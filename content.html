<p>Open source software is software that is released with a license that allows anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute the source code. This approach promotes collaboration and transparency, enabling developers to build upon each other's work and innovate more rapidly. Some examples of popular open source software include the Linux operating system, the Apache web server, and the Mozilla Firefox web browser.</p>

<p>Open source projects are typically developed by a community of volunteers and can be found on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. These projects often welcome contributions from anyone, regardless of their skill level, making it a great way to learn and gain experience in software development. Contributions to the codebase of an open source project will typically be reviewed and merged by the project maintainers, ensuring that the quality and integrity of the codebase is maintained.</p>

<p>Many open-source projects are well-established, have large user bases, and can form an important part of the software development ecosystem. Most open-source software is free to download and use.</p>
